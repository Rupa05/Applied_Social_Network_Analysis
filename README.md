# Applied_Social_Network_Analysis
: In this we've presented the network analysis of Social connections using
the NetworkX library. We worked on network analysis and why we might model
phenomena as networks, the concept of connectivity and network robustness. Then we
explored ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network. Then
finally worked on the evolution of networks over time and covered models of network
generation and the link prediction problem.
